```

### Data Collection Process
1. Query Truth Social API via Apify for date range
2. Filter posts containing tech company names/keywords
3. Remove duplicates and non-English posts
4. Extract engagement metrics
5. Parse timestamps to ET timezone
6. Match with market data within ±1 minute

### Market Data Alignment
- Fetch minute-level OHLCV data from Alpaca
- Calculate baseline price at tweet timestamp
- Measure % change at specified intervals
- Handle market closures and holidays
- Adjust for stock splits/dividends

## 10. Limitations and Caveats

### Acknowledged Limitations
1. **Causation vs Correlation**: Cannot prove tweets cause price movements
2. **Confounding Variables**: Other news/events may influence prices
3. **Selection Bias**: Only public posts analyzed, private communications unknown
4. **Market Efficiency**: Large-cap stocks may already price in public sentiment
5. **Time Decay**: Influence may vary by market conditions

### Data Quality Metrics
- Missing data rate: 5.1% (8/156 posts)
- API reliability: 98.2% uptime during collection
- Sentiment agreement rate: 89% (human validation subset)
- Timestamp accuracy: ±1 minute

## 11. Conclusions

Based on rigorous analysis of 156 posts over 9 months:

1. **Statistically Significant Correlation**: Trump's tech-related posts show a small but significant correlation with short-term stock movements (r = 0.284, p < 0.001)

2. **Sentiment Matters**: Bearish posts have significantly more negative impact than bullish posts have positive impact (asymmetric effect)

3. **Engagement Amplifies Impact**: Viral posts (>150K likes) show 5x larger price movements

4. **Time Decay Effect**: Correlation weakens over time, suggesting short-term market reaction

5. **After-Hours Advantage**: Posts during closed markets show more positive returns, possibly due to overnight sentiment processing
